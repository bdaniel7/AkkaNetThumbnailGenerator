Coolite is a great product, wrapping all <a href="http://www.extjs.com" target="_blank">Ext JS widgets</a> in an ASP.NET control. Upon ordering a license for both, we received two free copies of Packt&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1847195148?tag=maabalblo-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=1847195148&amp;adid=1XDFQWSA6XXTDH0HA75Q&amp;" target="_blank">&ldquo;Learning Ext JS&rdquo;</a>, providing better insight in what&rsquo;s going on behind the curtains of Coolite.</p>
<p>I only spent one evening reading this book and must admit: it&rsquo;s really great at getting you started quickly with Ext JS. You&rsquo;re working with grids, windows and your own grid column renderers, creating a nice looking application which enables you to&nbsp; manage your DVD collection. As a plus, almost every example features a character or quote from the best movie ever (as an ICT-er): <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/" target="_blank">Office Space</a>. This makes it a nice read (at least for me).</p>
<p>The people at <a href="http://www.coolite.com/" target="_blank">Coolite</a> actually did a great job providing this book with their license, as you get a better view of what they do when wrapping Ext JS widgets. If you&rsquo;re not buying Coolite or a commercial Ext JS license, there&rsquo;s always <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/learning-ext-js/book" target="_blank">Packt&rsquo;s website</a> offering this book for purchase, too. Nice read!</p>
