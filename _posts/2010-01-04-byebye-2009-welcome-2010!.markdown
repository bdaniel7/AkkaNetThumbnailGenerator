<p>A year just ended, a new has begun. Congratulations! Happy newyear 2010! And welcome in the next decennium. It&rsquo;s time for a 2009 wrap-up post. And perhaps, even the time for some things I want to do in 2010. First things first: the top 5 blog posts of 2009.</p>

<p>I did a similar list <a href="/post/2008/12/31/top-blog-posts-in-2008.aspx" target="_blank">last year</a>, and you can see that I actually can stop blogging. 4 posts are in the top 5 again, with one newcomer on the 1st place.</p>
<h2>Open-source in 2009</h2>
<p>What should I say about this one&hellip; I did a lot of that :-) I continued to work on <a href="http://www.phpexcel.net" target="_blank">PHPExcel</a>, <a href="http://www.phplinq.net" target="_blank">PHPLinq</a> and <a href="http://phppowerpoint.codeplex.com" target="_blank">PHPPowerPoint</a>, started work (with Microsoft) on the <a href="http://phpazure.codeplex.com" target="_blank">Windows Azure SDK for PHP</a>, released the <a href="http://mvcsitemap.codeplex.com" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC SiteMap Provider</a>, released <a href="http://twittermatic.codeplex.com" target="_blank">TwitterMatic</a> on CodePlex and did some contributions to <a href="http://framework.zend.com" target="_blank">Zend Framework</a>. Then there&rsquo;s also my port of <a href="/post/2009/12/02/PHP-Managed-Extensibility-Framework-e28093-PHPMEF.aspx" target="_blank">MEF to PHP</a>, which I will be releasing somewhere in Q1 2010.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot! And I really hope to keep the same pace going in 2010. I&rsquo;m constructing a house though, which also takes some time&hellip; Luckily: no windows yet, so I can consider it open-source as well :-)</p>
<h2>Presentations in 2009</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what we have there&hellip; A lot! And I hope to do the same amount (or more) in 2010. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/belux/techdays/2010/" target="_blank">TechDays Belgium</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/finland/techdays/techdays2010" target="_blank">TechDays Finland</a> and <a href="http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/speakers/maarten-balliauw/" target="_blank">PHPBenelux conference</a> have been confirmed already, a good start. Anyway: here&rsquo;s the 2009 list. Note that there&rsquo;s also some more at various schools in Belgium, and internal sessions for <a href="http://www.realdolmen.com" target="_blank">RealDolmen</a>.</p>

My first one, but probably not the last one. Don&rsquo;t know when and on what, but I&rsquo;ll probably find the energy to do this effort again. Here&rsquo;s a quite from my <a href="/post/2009/02/17/Announcing-my-book-ASPNET-MVC-10-Quickly.aspx" target="_blank">announcement post</a>:</p>

<h2>Most valuable professional</h2>
<p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" src="/images/image_29.png" border="0" alt="image" width="97" height="52" align="left" /> In July 2009, I became an <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile/Maarten.Balliauw" target="_blank">MVP ASP.NET</a>. Let&rsquo;s see if we can repeat this for 2010 :-)</p>
<p>My focus was still on ASP.NET MVC in 2009, but also more and more on Windows Azure. These two make a great combination, and will be the main topics for my blog in 2010 as well.</p>
<h2>Traveling</h2>
<p>Some traveling in 2009 as well. I went on a ski vacation and a summer vacation, but next to that I did some traveling for work as well:</p>

<p>If only I knew that these last two would provide me a lot of airmiles&hellip; Subscribed at <a href="http://www.milesandmore.com">www.milesandmore.com</a> for possible traveling in 2010 :-)</p>
<h2>Thank you!</h2>
<p>I do take credit for all that I did in 2009, but I would also like to thank my company <a href="http://www.realdolmen.com" target="_blank">RealDolmen</a> for providing enough room to do some of this during work hours, as well as for challenging me in this. Really appreciated guys!</p>
<p>Now is also a great moment to thank my family for not whining too much and also giving me the room to do all of this, often taking time out of family life. Thanks for letting me do all this!</p>
<h2>Summary and look ahead</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a relaxing year. No, seriously: I&rsquo;ve been busy, and I expect the same for 2010&hellip; Not sure if I can do 79 blog posts again, but I will sure try. And in order to do that, I need some input from you:</p>
<ul>
<li>What topics would you like to see covered?</li>
<li>Is there anything you want to learn more about?</li>
<li>A great conceptual idea, no time to work on it? Shoot! Maybe I will work on it.</li>
<li>Any other feedback for me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy 2010! I will.</p>
