<p>After the summer, I'll be joining <a href="http://devitect.net/" target="_blank">Kurt Claeys</a> and <a href="http://www.goeleven.com/" target="_blank">Yves Goeleven</a> and for the start of the Azure User Group Belgium (or AZUG.BE).&#160; AZUG.BE is a Belgian user group with focus on development and architecture of the Microsoft Azure Services Platform. Azure is a cloud hosted development platform for internet oriented applications aimed at high scalability and based on .NET technology. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.azug.be" target="_blank"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="azuglogo" border="0" alt="azuglogo" src="/images/azuglogo.gif" width="240" height="101" /></a> </p>  <p>Our goal is to share knowledge and experiences with the .NET community in development and architecture in the Azure Services Platform and the .NET Services technology. As new programming skills and a new architectural approach are needed we are inviting you to become member of this user group to prepare you for building this new style of applications. </p>  <p>We’ll have regular public meetings (free of charge) providing demos, training, presentations and discussions on the technology part of Azure. First public meeting is planned in september 09. E-mail us at <a href="mailto:newsletter@azug.be">newsletter@azug.be</a> with the word subscribe as subject. We’ll inform you on what, when and where.</p>  <p>Interested in participating as boardmember ? Shoot a mail at <a href="mailto:board@azug.be">board@azug.be</a>.</p>  <p>Hope to see you!</p>
