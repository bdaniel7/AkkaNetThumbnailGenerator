<p><img style="width: 135px; display: block; float: none; height: 105px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="DevDays09, The Netherlands" src="/images/logo.jpg" border="0" alt="DevDays09, The Netherlands" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="135" height="105" align="right" />Some Great news (at least: I think this is great :-)): <a href="http://kevindockx.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Kevin Dockx</a> and I will be giving a session on PHP and Silverlight at the Netherlands <a href="http://www.devdays.nl" target="_blank">DevDays09</a>. This event, aimed totally at developers, will take place on May 28 and 29th in The Hague (Den Haag). It&rsquo;s the first time the DevDays are hosting sessions related to PHP, and it&rsquo;s also the first time I&rsquo;ll be speaking at an event of this size.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.devdays.nl/sessies/detail.aspx?code=PHP03IB">Our session</a> will cover the basics of Silverlight and show you how you can create rich web applications using the best of 2 worlds: Silverlight and PHP.</p>
<p><img style="width: 159px; display: block; float: none; height: 144px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="dpc09_speaker" src="/images/dpc09_speaker.jpg" border="0" alt="dpc09_speaker" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="159" height="144" align="left" />Next to this event, we&rsquo;ll be doing this very same session at the <a href="http://www.phpconference.nl/" target="_blank">Dutch PHP Conference</a> in Amsterdam, which will take place June 11 &ndash; June 13th. Yes,&nbsp;we are evil, doing a presentation on Microsoft technologies at a PHP event.</p>
<p>And now that I&rsquo;m announcing upcoming sessions anyway&hellip; I&rsquo;ll be doing a <a href="http://www.visug.be/Eventdetails/tabid/95/EventId/4/Default.aspx">session on mocking at VISUG</a> (Visual Studio User Group Belgium). Come visit us at May 7th! This session will show you the basics of unit testing without having to rely on external dependencies like databases, WCF services, ... and will show you how you can reproduce behaviour in a unit test that might be otherwide difficult to test.</p>
<p>Oh, and another one: MSDN Belgium is hosting some virtual events. I&rsquo;ll be doing a session on the ASP.NET MVC framework (in Dutch) on April 23 at 14:00. Check the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/belux/msdn/nl/livemeetingevents/" target="_blank">MSDN pages</a> for more info (yet to come). Here&rsquo;s the abstract of that session:</p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border-style: none; padding: 0px"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic">"Join us for this 90 min session and get a developer-focused overview on ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller), a new approach in building ASP.NET applications. Learn how the new ASP.NET MVC framework differs and can be an alternative to the current ASP.NET Web Forms framework. This session will help you to learn how to take advantage of ASP.NET MVC to build loosely coupled, highly testable, agile applications. You will see how ASP.NET MVC provides you with fine-grained control over both HTML and JavaScript."</span><br />
