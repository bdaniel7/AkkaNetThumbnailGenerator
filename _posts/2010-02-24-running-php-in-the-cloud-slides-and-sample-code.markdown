<p>Just got back from London where I did a fun talk on PHP and Windows Azure yesterday evening. It was the first time I did a presentation after three beers, but I think it went allright. As promised, here's the slide deck and sample code (<a href="/files/2010/2/ImageCloud.rar">ImageCloud.rar (5.00 mb)</a>).</p>

<p>Abstract: "<em>This session covers the basics of Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Azure cloud platform. Learn how you can develop and deploy a PHP application in Windows Azure, using the tools and libraries Microsoft provides. Creating a photo upload application, the different aspects of the Windows Azure platform are leveraged for creating a performant and scalable PHP application.</em>"</p>

<p>Thanks for joining the conference and my session! Also, <a href="http://www.codepositive.com/">Robert Castelo</a>, your talk on Drupal and its community was interesting. Did not know the active developer base and security teams were that big.</p>
