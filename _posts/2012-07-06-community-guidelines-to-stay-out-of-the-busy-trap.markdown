<p>For the past few days, an interesting blog post on the <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/">NY Times</a> has been popping up in my Twitter timeline. In your as well, probably, since almost everyone I know has retweeted it a couple of times. Which blog post? The one about the so-called &ldquo;<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/">busy trap</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: we&rsquo;re all caught in the busy trap. Everyone feels busy, runs their life and activities at 200%. Here&rsquo;s a great summary from the blog post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The present hysteria is not a necessary or inevitable condition of life; it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve chosen, if only by our acquiescence to it. Not long ago I Skyped with a friend who was driven out of the city by high rent and now has an artist&rsquo;s residency in a small town in the south of France. She described herself as happy and relaxed for the first time in years. She still gets her work done, but it doesn&rsquo;t consume her entire day and brain. She says it feels like college &mdash; she has a big circle of friends who all go out to the cafe together every night. She has a boyfriend again. (She once ruefully summarized dating in New York: &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s too busy and everyone thinks they can do better.&rdquo;) What she had mistakenly assumed was her personality &mdash; driven, cranky, anxious and sad &mdash; turned out to be a deformative effect of her environment. It&rsquo;s not as if any of us wants to live like this, any more than any one person wants to be part of a traffic jam or stadium trampling or the hierarchy of cruelty in high school &mdash; it&rsquo;s something we collectively force one another to do. <em>&ndash; From </em><a title="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/" href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/"><em>http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/</em></a></p>

<p>Everyone I know from the Belgian IT community is in this trap. I&rsquo;m in there. My wife is in there. My boss probably is, too. We&rsquo;re all too busy to realize this. We&rsquo;re used to it, and it&rsquo;s really easy to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to things because those things nag you and you just want to get them over with. And the easy way often is not saying &ldquo;no way!&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s often just doing it. Reinforcing that same busy trap.</p>
<p>Lately, some people I know quit their 16-hours-per-day-consultancy-job and switched to a nine-to-five closer to home to gain time for themselves. Another one is maxed out and on the verge of cracking and relying on social security for a couple of weeks, if not months (if you are this person or you know him, have a break and get well soon buddy!). I find myself in this busy trap too, but I usually manage to balance it pretty well. There are of course periods in the year where the balance flips over to busy, but I have established a few ground rules that I agreed on with my wife and family.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the week, I&rsquo;m owned by the community (and work, that too). That does not mean I will be out every night to some event (our Belgian community has interesting sessions almost daily). It does mean that I don&rsquo;t really have a problem being out one evening a week.</li>
<li>The weekend is sacred. Weekend mean: No computer will be switched on. Ever. Unless it&rsquo;s to <a href="http://www.pizza.be">order pizza</a> or to do taxes or something.</li>
<li>In the weekend, don&rsquo;t use Twitter. Unless an occasional check (some of my friends don&rsquo;t txt me, they send me tweets) or to tweet about drinking/brewing beer or having a great barbecue.</li>
<li>Vacation? Long weekend? The computer stays at home. Roaming and wifi on the smartphone get disabled. Phone call from anyone but close relatives and friends? Ignore it (by pushing the <em>ignore</em> button, voice mail will handle it).</li>
</ul>
<p>These don&rsquo;t get you out of the busy trap, but it will help. It certainly helps me. Which rules help for you? Comments welcomed!</p>
<p><strong>[edit]</strong></p>
<p>Here's a list of tips I got from the community:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/ToJans" target="_blank">@ToJans</a>: Another tip: treat the hours you invest in your work as a limited resource; this will help you to focus on what's important</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/DavyBrion" target="_blank">@DavyBrion</a>: don't waste spare time when you don't feel like it, and keep in mind that you don't owe it to anyone</li>
