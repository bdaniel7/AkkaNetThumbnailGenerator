They renamed Urchin's project to <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" mce_href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and started a beta for some. Today, it seems Google has opened Analytics for everyone. Get it while it's hot, they really provide in-depth statistics about what's happening on your website. </p><p>I tried it out for a few days on my website <a href="http://www.holidayhome.be" mce_href="http://www.holidayhome.be">Holidayhome.be</a>, and&nbsp;experienced all possibilities. Currently, I use <a href="http://www.statcounter.com" mce_href="http://www.statcounter.com">Statcounter</a> there, which also provides detailed statistics, but only for the last 100 visits. </p><p>One of the nice things on GA is that you can specify up to four goals for your website. A goal can be a user registration, an order, ... GA then tracks how many of your visitors reach one of those goals, and provides you with a conversion percentage. This can be handy to improve your website for better conversion. </p><p>Also, there are three different report views: Executive, Marketer and Webmaster, all showing statistics from a different angle. A webmaster might be interested in which browsers are visiting, an executive might benefit to know the conversion percentage. </p><p>Anyway, I'm keeping GA on Holidayhome and my blog, it provides in-depth stats and clear reporting.</p>
