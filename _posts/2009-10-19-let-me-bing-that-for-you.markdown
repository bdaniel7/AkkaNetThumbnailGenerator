<p>Have you ever been bugged with stupid questions? Do you get tired of people asking stuff that is only one search engine query away? Chances are you answered both of these questions with &ldquo;yes!&rdquo;. Together with <a href="http://www.haacked.com">Phil Haack</a> and <a href="http://www.hanssens.org">Juli&euml;n Hanssens</a>, I created <a href="http://www.letmebingthatforyou.com/">LetMeBingThatForYou.com</a>, a website that generates a search engine query for people who ask you questions they could easily answer by themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yfj4f3v" target="_blank"></a>Yes, the idea is a copy of <a href="http://www.letmegooglethatforyou.com">LetMeGoogleThatForYou.com</a>. However, we thought <a href="http://www.bing.com">Bing</a> deserved something similar. We even got Bing&rsquo;s picture of the day working. How cool is that?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="margin-top: 5px; display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; border: 0px;" title="Find Chuck Norris" src="/images/image_17.png" border="0" alt="Find Chuck Norris" width="630" height="484" /></p>
<p>One last note: this project is not associated with Microsoft nor Bing. We&rsquo;re doing this project for fun.</p>
