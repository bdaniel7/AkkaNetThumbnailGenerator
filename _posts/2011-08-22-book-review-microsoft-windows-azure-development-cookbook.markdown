During this review I had no idea who the author of the book was but after publishing it seems the author is no one less than my fellow Windows Azure MVP <a href="http://convective.wordpress.com">Neil Mackenzie</a>! If you read his blog you should know you should immediately <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1849682224/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=maabalblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1849682224">buy this book</a>.</p>
<p>Why? Well, Neil usually goes both broad and deep: all required context for understanding a recipe is given and the recipe itself goes deep enough to know most of the ins and outs of a specific feature of Windows Azure. Well written, to the point and clear to every reader both novice and expert.</p>
<p>The book is one of a series of <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/books/cookbooks">cookbooks</a> published by Packt. They are intended to provide &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; showing how to implement specific techniques in a particular technology. They don&rsquo;t cover getting started scenarios, but do cover some basic techniques, some more advanced techniques and usually one or two expert techniques. From the cookbooks I&rsquo;ve read, this approach works and should get you up to speed real quick. And that&rsquo;s no different with this one.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a chapter overview:</p>
<ol>
<li>Controlling Access in the Windows Azure Platform</li>
<li>Handling Blobs in Windows Azure</li>
<li>Going NoSQL with Windows Azure Tables</li>
<li>Disconnecting with Windows Azure Queues</li>
<li>Developing Hosted Services for Windows Azure</li>
<li>Digging into Windows Azure Diagnostics</li>
<li>Managing Hosted Services with the Service Management API</li>
<li>Using SQL Azure</li>
<li>Looking at the Windows Azure AppFabric</li>
</ol>
<p>An interesting <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/2220-chapter-7-managing-hosted-services-with-the-service-management-api.pdf?utm_source=packtpub&amp;utm_medium=free&amp;utm_campaign=pdf" target="_blank">sample chapter on the Service Management API can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>Oh and before I forget: <a href="http://convective.wordpress.com">Neil</a>, congratulations on your book!&nbsp; It was a pleasure doing the reviewing!</p>
