<p>A while ago, <a href="http://www.dragonbe.com" target="_blank">Michelangelo van Dam</a> (a hardcore PHP guy), <a href="https://www.azure-roadtrip.be/?page_id=96" target="_blank">Fran&ccedil;ois Hertay</a> (a hardcore Java guru) and myself (a .NET guy) were asked if we wanted to write about some of our experiences with the Windows Azure platform.</p>
<p>Starting next week, you&rsquo;ll find about 3 blog posts per week and/or videos on Windows Azure (both a getting started level as well as some fun advanced posts) on a freshly released website: <a href="http://www.azure-roadtrip.be">www.azure-roadtrip.be</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the honour of kicking off a series of blog posts on .NET, starting with a level 100 one: the <a href="https://www.azure-roadtrip.be/?p=854" target="_blank">what &amp; why of Windows Azure for .NET developers</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s knock at an open door: Windows Azure is a cloud platform. It&rsquo;s a group of services offered by Microsoft that enable you to build your applications using the typical characteristics of a cloud platform: everything is self-service, on-demand and pay-per-use. You are the one demanding resources like virtual machines or storage and you pay for what you use, depending on how much you use for how long. No contract periods &ndash; well, there is one: you always pay for at least one hour if you use these resources.</p>
