<p>Today, I noticed that <a href="http://www.php-compiler.net/" mce_href="http://www.php-compiler.net/">Phalanger</a> has released a new beta a few days ago (well OK, half a month ago [*-)]). Phalanger is an open-source project, aiming to provide tools to integrate PHP development in Visual Studio on one side, and aiming to provide a CLR compiler for PHP on the other side. </p><p>In short, this means that Phalanger compiles PHP code to MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) and thus can run PHP on the .NET Framework. I guess that would mean a huge PHP speed improvement! </p><p>Also, Phalanger provides access to native .NET namespaces, which can be used within PHP scripts. Nice! Imagine ASP.NET webcontrols and PHP code... For me, it sounds like a nice dream [Y]. </p><p>I guess I'll have to check that all out. It's placed on my to-do list, which seems to always get filled more and more... </p>
