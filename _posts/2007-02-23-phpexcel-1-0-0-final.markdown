Since my last post on this, a lot of things happened, feature-wise and project-wise. </p><p>Feature-wise, conditional formatting was added, and a first attempt to a Excel2007 file reader has been created. Project-wise, Jakub Vrana signed up as a developer. He's currently working on an improved version of the Excel2007 Reader. </p><p>We are still looking for extra developers: if you know PHP 5, object-oriented programming, have knowledge of/interest in OpenXML or the Open Document Format (as we plan to include that too), <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel" mce_href="http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel">please apply</a>. </p>
