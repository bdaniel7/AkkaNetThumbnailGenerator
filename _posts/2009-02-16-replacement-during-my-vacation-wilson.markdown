This morning, I arrived at work after a great week of skiing in <a href="http://www.pitztaler-gletscher.at/" target="_blank">Pitztal</a>, Austria. Unfortunately, I found my chair occupied by a new colleague looking a bit like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_the_Volleyball" target="_blank">Wilson</a>. Good to see he enjoyed working early, like I do. But still, that was my seat and PC he was using&hellip; Thank you, dear colleagues, to see myself replaced by a plastic, smiling ball&hellip;
