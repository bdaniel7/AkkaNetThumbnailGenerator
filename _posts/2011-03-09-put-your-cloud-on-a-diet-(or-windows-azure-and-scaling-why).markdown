In this blog post series, I will talk about the following:</p>

<h2>Windows Azure and scaling: why?</h2>
<p>Both for small and large project, scaling your application&rsquo;s capacity to meet the actual demand can be valuable. Imagine a local web application that is being used mostly during office hours, with peak demand from 6 PM to 8 PM. It consists of 4 web role instances running all day, which is enough to cope with peaks. Also, the number can be increased over time to meet actual demand of the web application.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a cost breakdown of that&hellip; In short, one small instance on Windows Azure will cost $ 0.12 per hour per instance, totaling $ 11.52 per day for this setup. If you do this estimation for a month, costs will be somewhere around $ 345.14 for the compute demand of this application, not counting storage and bandwidth.</p>
<p>Flashback one paragraph: peak load is during office hours and from 6 PM to 8 PM. Interesting, as this may mean the application can be running on less instances for the hours off-peak. Even more interesting: there are no office hours in the weekend (unless, uhmm, Bill Lumbergh needs you to come and work). Here&rsquo;s a closer estimate of the required number of instances, per hour of day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/image_107.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Windows Azure cost breakdown" src="/images/image_thumb_77.png" border="0" alt="Windows Azure cost breakdown" width="504" height="209" /></a></p>
<p>Interesting! If these values are extrapolated to a month, costs will be somewhere around $ 219.31 for the compute demand of this application, not counting storage and bandwidth. That&rsquo;s more than a $ 100 difference with the &ldquo;always 4 instances&rdquo; situation. Or over $ 1200 yearly. Imagine having a really big project and doing this: that&rsquo;s a lot of beer difference :-)</p>
<p>Of course, this is a rough estimation, but it clearly shows there is value in scaling up and down at the right moments. The example I gave is based on a local application with clear demand differences during each day and could be scaled based on the time of day. And that&rsquo;s what I will be demonstrating in the next 2 blog posts of this series: how to scale up and down automatically using the current tooling available for Windows Azure. Stay tuned!</p>
