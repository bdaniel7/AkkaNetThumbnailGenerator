<p>I regularly drink a glass of beer (I prefer the Belgian Trappists) or a glass of wine. While surfing, I stumbled upon a handy link for all Belgian people who love to drink wine too: <a href="http://www.kurkdroog.be/" mce_href="http://www.kurkdroog.be/">Kurkdroog</a> </p><p>Kurkdroog is a website that acts as a hitlist of wines. You can select a price class, a supermarket, a country and a wine type (red, white, ros√©, ...), and the site returns a list of wines matching your criteria, with the price and a short review next to it. Perfect stuff!</p>
