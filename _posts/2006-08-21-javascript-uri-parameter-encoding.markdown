<p>When creating a HTTP request in JavaScript, I always used encode() and decode() to pass data between client and server. I also used this approach in <a href="http://prajax.sf.net" mce_href="http://prajax.sf.net">PRAjax</a>, my open-source Ajax helper library for PHP. </p><p>A developer working with PRAjax on his site reported to me last week that Swedish characters like&nbsp;å, ä, ö, ...&nbsp;were not passed corerctly to and from the server. </p><p>My first reaction was: add a UTF-8 header on the server side, and it should work. Characters from other character sets are always displayed correctly when doing that. Except when using JavaScript, it seemed when I tried entering Swedish... </p><p>After stepping through my code, I saw everything went wrong after I did encode() on my JavaScript&nbsp;variable. After an hour of different Google searches in the wrong direction, I found out that when using encodeURIComponent() instead of encode(), everything worked fine. It seems like encodeURIComponent() translates more characters than encode().</p>
