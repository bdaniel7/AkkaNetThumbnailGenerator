For once, one without the typical orange/black cover but instead a classy white/black cover: <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/refactoring-with-microsoft-visual-studio-2010/book" target="_blank">Refactoring with Visual Studio 2010 by Peter Ritchie</a>.</p>  <p>Since my book shelf is quite heavy on the Packt side (really, almost have their complete collection I guess, they keep sending me books), I was a bit in doubt if I should write yet another review for one of their books as I think I’m starting to sound like a Packt marketing guy. After reading it though, I thought that this book deserves some credit!</p>  <p>I’m going to skip the official wording on what the book is all about: the title suggest refactoring with Visual Studio 2010, but that title covers only 5% of the book’s contents. This is also reflected in the book: it describes a refactoring, in 8 out of 10 cases followed by a sentence “that this refactoring is not supported in Visual Studio 2010”. However, all refactorings are clearly explained with practical, easy to grasp sample code.</p>  <p>So this book is partially about refactoring and a little bit about Visual Studio 2010. However, the main content that makes this book valuable to me is that it covers a lot of design patterns, software design principles and object-oriented concepts. As an example, check the sample <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/0103-chapter-6-improving-class-quality.pdf">'Chapter 6 &quot;Improving Class Quality'</a>. It talks about the single responsibility principle and starts refactoring an ugly, tight coupled class into a nice, easy to maintain class with lots of practical tips and sample code.</p>  <p>My recommendation for anyone: must read! Not for the VS2010 refactoring part, but for the design patterns &amp; object-oriented principles clearly explained in the book.</p>
