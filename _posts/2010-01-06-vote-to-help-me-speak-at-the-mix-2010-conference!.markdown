<p>Everybody knows the Microsoft <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/" target="_blank">MIX</a> event, right? The one in Las Vegas? The one with all the fancy web-related stuff? Rings a bell? Ok, great. In the beginning of December 2009, Microsoft did an open call for speakers, which I answered with some session proposals. Who doesn&rsquo;t want to go to Vegas, right?</p>
<p>The open call proposals have been processed (150+ sessions submitted, wow!) and a voting has started. Yes, you hear me coming: <a href="http://bit.ly/6A0dyC" target="_blank">please go ahead and vote for a session I submitted</a>. Voting ends January 15th, 2010.</p>
<p>Since I could not decide which color of the voting banner matched best with my blog&rsquo;s theme, I decided to put them all three online:</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/6A0dyC" target="_blank"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="image" src="/images/image_37.png" border="0" alt="image" width="644" height="289" /></a></p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
