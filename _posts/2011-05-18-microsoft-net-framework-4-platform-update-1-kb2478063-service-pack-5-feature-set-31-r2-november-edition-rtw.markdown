<p>As you can see, a new .NET Framework version just came out. Read about it at <a title="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/endpoint/archive/2011/04/18/microsoft-net-framework-4-platform-update-1.aspx" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/endpoint/archive/2011/04/18/microsoft-net-framework-4-platform-update-1.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/endpoint/archive/2011/04/18/microsoft-net-framework-4-platform-update-1.aspx</a>. Now why does my title not match with the title from the blog post I referenced? Well&hellip; How is this going to help people?</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t see the problem, let me explain&hellip; If we get new people on board that are not yet proficient enough in .NET, they all struggle with some concepts. Concepts like: service packs for a development framework. Or better: client profile stuff! Stuff that breaks their code because stuff is missing in there! I feel like this is going the Java road where every version has a billion updates associated with it. That&rsquo;s not where we want to go, right? The Java side?</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m saying: why not make things clear and call these &ldquo;updates&rdquo; something like .NET 4.1 or so? Simple major/minor versions. We&rsquo;re developers, not marketeers. We&rsquo;re developers, not ITPro who enjoy these strange names to bill yet another upgrade to their customers</p>
<p>How am I going to persuade my manager to move to the next version? Telling him that we now should use &ldquo;Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Platform Update 1 KB2478063&rdquo; instead of telling &ldquo;hey, there&rsquo;s a new .NET 4! It&rsquo;s .NET 4.1 and it&rsquo;s shiny and new!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It seems I&rsquo;m not alone with this thought. <a href="http://hadihariri.com/2011/05/18/did-you-just-take-a-dump-on-standard-versioning-practices/">Hadi Hariri</a> also blogged about it. And I expect more to follow...&nbsp;If you feel the same: now is the time to stop this madness! I suspect there&rsquo;s an R2 November Edition coming otherwise&hellip;</p>
<p>[Edit @ 14:00] <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/discussions/255640">Here's how to use it in NuGet</a>. Seems this thing is actually ".NET 4.0.1" under the hood.<br />[Edit @ 14:01] And here's <a href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/DesktopDev/MSTech/MSAccess/AccessFormsReports/did-you-notice-there-is">another one</a>. And <a href="http://coolthingoftheday.blogspot.com/2011/04/ft-then-fp-and-sp-now-pu-power-tools.html">another one</a>.<br />[Edit] And Scott Hanselman chimes in: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/RequestForCommentsIssuesWithNETAndMicrosoftProductVersioning.aspx">www.hanselman.com/.../...oftProductVersioning.aspx</a></p>
