<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/plankytronixx/" target="_blank">Steve Plank</a> from Microsoft UK has just announced the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/plankytronixx/archive/2010/09/13/uk-windows-azure-online-conference-date-change-now-8th-october.aspx" target="_blank">UK Windows Azure Online Conference</a> on his blog. This will be a whole day, online Windows Azure conference consisting of three different tracks: Cirrus – the high level stuff, Altocumulus – the mid level stuff (cast studies) and Stratocumulus – the low level stuff (deep tech). I’ll be doing a session in the Stratocumulus track.</p>  <p>Since this is an online conference, feel free to subscribe for the event! All details can be found on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/plankytronixx/archive/2010/09/13/uk-windows-azure-online-conference-date-change-now-8th-october.aspx" target="_blank">UK Windows Azure Online Conference</a> announcement. I feel this is going to be very interesting, covering a broad range of Windows Azure topics! Here’s the list of sessions I’ll try to attend:</p>  <ul>   <li>Case studies in the Altocumulus track, these should be very interesting real-life examples</li>    <li>Of course my own session, “Taking care of a cloud environment”, since otherwise there would be no speaker in that slot…</li>    <li>Windows Azure Guidance Project</li>    <li>Azure Table Service – getting creative with Microsoft’s NoSQL datastore</li>    <li>The Q&amp;A panel sessions</li> </ul>  <p>The only thing I’m wondering about: how are they going to provide lunch through Live Meeting…</p>
