The people from <A href="http://www.eurobesthosting.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.eurobesthosting.com">Eurobesthosting.com</A> (shameless commercial plug in my blog) provided me my own ASP.NET server, which is now serving this page/RSS feed to you!</P>
<P>A new home also means new URL's... I did my best forwarding all old URL's to this new page, but I won't keep the forwarding for the next century... The only noteworthy thing for you as a RSS reader, is the RSS feed URL, which has changed to: <A href="/rss.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="/blogs/maarten/rss.aspx">/rss.aspx</A>.</P>
<P>If you placed a link to my blog on your website, please change that link to <A href="/" target=_blank mce_href="/blogs/maarten/">/</A>.&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
