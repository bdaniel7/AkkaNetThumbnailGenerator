I’ve just learned that I’m invited to join the <a href="http://aspinsiders.com/">ASPInsiders</a>. I’m really excited and honored to be part of this <a href="http://aspinsiders.com/Insiders.aspx">group of great ASP.NET experts</a>. Very much looking forward to learning the <em>secret handshake</em> and being able to provide feedback that helps the ASP.NET team forward.</p>  <p>If don’t know who the ASP Insiders are, here’s their elevator pitch:</p>  
<blockquote>   <p>“The ASPInsiders is a select group of international professionals who have demonstrated expertise in ASP.NET technologies and who provide valuable, early feedback on related developing technologies and publications to their peers, the Microsoft ASP.NET team and others.”</p>
