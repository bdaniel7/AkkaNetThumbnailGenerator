At the start of 2015, [I checked out from JetBrains](https://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2015/01/27/sjetbrainsmicrosoft.html) to join Microsoft. Today, after almost two years in the [NuGet team](https://www.nuget.org), it's time for change. Microsoft and NuGet have been a fun ride, and I got to complete my personal mission... I remember [Paul Stack](https://twitter.com/stack72) trolling me ("Hey Maarten, is NuGet down?") on more than one occasion, and am really happy that I got the freedom and support for changing that. The quest towards server stability even got me a well-received conference talk, ["Sherlock Homepage"](/talks-presentations.html). Thanks Jeff (x2), Yishai, Hari, Jun and team! Mission accomplished! And thanks for the great walks in wonderful Washington state when I was over there, I'll sure miss stopping by that region every once in a while.

So what's next? A couple of things. Most of the time I'll be working with [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com) again as a Developer Advocate. When I left there, Hadi told me: "Dude, you know this is like Hotel California, right? You can check out, but never leave." Guess I'm checking in again.

I'll be carving some more time to work on [MyGet](https://www.myget.org) in my agenda. It remains the product [Xavier](https://www.xavierdecoster.com) and I build and care about. We have lots of plans there as well, and will keep executing those. We'll continue to provide the great service and support you're used to!

I discovered a new passion while at Microsoft: mentoring and coaching devs, as well as diving deep into the innards of an application to track down hard-to-find bugs, optimize performance, ... I want to be speaking at conferences on these topics, and if you feel like being my "war story", you can always [hire me](/hire-me.html) for some short-term gigs.

Now let's roll! I do hope Hotel California's [room service is better than it used to be on Monday mornings...](https://twitter.com/hhariri/status/278024879062777859)
