Around February 2013, <a href="http://www.xavierdecoster.com">Xavier</a> and I started planning work on an update of our book. Eight months later, we&rsquo;re proud to present you with <a href="http://amzn.to/pronuget2">Pro NuGet (second edition)</a>. It&rsquo;s been a tough couple of months writing this: Xavier has become a father for the second time (congratulations!), we&rsquo;ve had two massive updates to NuGet we had to work in our book, &hellip; But here it is!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s new?</p>
<ul>
<li>A number of workflows with NuGet have changed and have been added. Expect all of these, including NuGet&rsquo;s old and new package restore functionality.</li>
<li>Want to work with <a href="http://www.nuget.org">NuGet</a> and Windows Azure Websites, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity">TeamCity</a>, <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Online</a>, <a href="http://www.OctopusDeploy.com">OctopusDeploy</a>, <a href="http://gitgub.com/nuget/nugetgallery">NuGet Gallery</a>, <a href="http://www.inedo.com/proget">ProGet</a> or <a href="http://www.myget.org">MyGet</a>? We have a bunch of recipes for you!</li>
<li>Pitfalls of package versioning</li>
<li>Building a plugin system based on NuGet</li>
</ul>
<p>Next to that there is a lot more meat in there!</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how NuGet fits into the big picture of your software development process to save you time and money.</li>
<li>How to keep your team working when your project depends on an external resource (such as a web service or cloud) which suddenly becomes unavailable.</li>
<li>Whether or not to auto-update NuGet packages within a continuous integration process for maximum reliability and speed.</li>
<li>How to combine NuGet with PowerShell to create your own Cmdlets and extend the base toolset in an extremely powerful manner.</li>
<li>Evaluate the pros-and-cons of hosting your own NuGet repository.</li>
<li>How to incorporate NuGet seamlessly within your continuous integration process.</li>
<li>Much much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>We would love to get your feedback! E-mail us or write a review on your blog or Amazon. Enjoy the read!</p>
<p><em>PS: Thanks to our excellent reviewers (the NuGet team) and everyone at </em><a href="http://www.apress.com"><em>Apress</em></a><em>! There is a lot of people involved in getting a quality book out there. Thanks!</em></p>
