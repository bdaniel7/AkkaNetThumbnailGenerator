My old screen, a IIyama 17 inch monster weighing CRT, needed a replacement. Not because of it's age, but because I really started hating this huge block on my desk. </p><p>The SyncMaster is a great screen. Not the newest, not the most feature-loaded, but it delivers a 1440 x 900 resolution (nice if you are used to 1024 x 768!) and DVI. Photo's, regular use, ... all is really sharp on screen. If you're looking for a cheap wide screen TFT, this one's great! </p><p>Something off-topic: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel" mce_href="http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel">PHPExcel</a> has already been downloaded more than 700 times!
